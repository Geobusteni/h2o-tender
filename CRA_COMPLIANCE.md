# EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) Compliance

## Overview

This document addresses compliance with the EU Cyber Resilience Act (Regulation 2024/2847) which entered into force on December 10, 2024.

## Exemption Status

**H2O Tender qualifies for the FOSS exemption under the CRA.**

### Basis for Exemption

According to the CRA, free and open-source software that is **not monetized** by its manufacturers is exempt from manufacturer obligations. Specifically:

> "The provision of products with digital elements qualifying as free and open-source software that are not monetised by their manufacturers should not be considered to be a commercial activity."

### This Project Meets Exemption Criteria Because:

1. **Open Source License**: Released under GPL-3.0, a recognized FOSS license
2. **No Monetization**: No fees, subscriptions, or payments required
3. **No Commercial Activity**: Not sold, not bundled with paid products
4. **Community Project**: Developed and maintained voluntarily
5. **No Paid Support**: No commercial support offerings

## What This Means

As exempt FOSS, this project:

- Is NOT subject to CRA manufacturer obligations
- Is NOT required to provide EU declarations of conformity
- Is NOT required to undergo conformity assessments
- Is NOT subject to CRA administrative fines

## Voluntary Security Practices

Although exempt, we voluntarily maintain good security practices:

- Vulnerability reporting process (see SECURITY.md)
- Dependency monitoring
- Security-conscious development
- Transparent issue tracking

## For Users Integrating This Software

1. Assess CRA obligations for your product
2. Conduct your own security review
